 * ThreadPool is a class which creates a thread pool that reuses a fixed
 * number of threads to execute tasks.
 * At any point, at most nThreads threads will be active processing tasks.
 * If additional tasks are submitted when all threads are active,
 * they will wait in the queue until a thread is available.
 *
 * Once shutdown of ThreadPool is initiated, previously submitted tasks are
 * executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.
